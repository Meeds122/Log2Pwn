The plan so far is to have this as an easy, automated, log4shell exploiter. It should do the following:
1. SCAN host FOR open ports
2. FOR EACH port IN open ports
    1. IF port NOT WITHIN blacklist
        1. IF port WITHIN known ports
            1. TRY KNOWN EXPLOIT TO CONFIRM EXPLOITABILITY
        2. ELSE
            1. SEND EXPLOIT STRING TO CONFIRM EXPLOITABILITY
        3. NOTE port exploitability status
3. SHOW user list of ports and exploitability statuses
4. PROMT user for exploit attempt and port
5. GENERATE reverse shell
6. CREATE SERVER FOR reverse shell
7. CREATE reverse shell HANDLER
8. SEND EXPLOIT STRING
